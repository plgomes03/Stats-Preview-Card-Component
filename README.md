## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- GIMP (purple image)

### What I learned

In this project I learned some positioning and Flexbox properties, how to follow a real project example and it made me learn the basic of GitHub in the end.

Code snippet that I liked:

```css
/*How to center using flexbox*/
main {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;/*100% of the viewport height*/
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;/*defines the alignment along the main axis*/
    align-items: center; /*justify-content version for the cross-axis*/
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focus on getting better on my CSS, because there are a lot for me to learn like:
- Box Bodel
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Custom Layouts
- Media Queries
- Rem Units
- SASS
- Bootstrap (HTML/CSS)

Also I want to improve my JS skills that I plan on doing in my next projects.
